            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Bagel Bizzness got it's start in Seattle in 1920.  Bob Baagel began it all in his kitchen
            making chicken dumpling soup when he discovered his dumplings were more like bagels.  Bob tested his creation
          on his dog, Bagley who seemed to enjoy them.  Today, Bobs family carries on the tradition expanding it's repertoire
        to include a new feature called Pairings.  We hope you enjoy!!!</p>
